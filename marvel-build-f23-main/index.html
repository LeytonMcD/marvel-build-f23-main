Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. </p>

                Morty Smith - The Grandson
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text"> Morty is Rick Sanchez's grandson and was often forced to tag along on his various misadventures as a sidekick whilst attending Harry Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer. At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. He had little say in the adventures he went on with Rick and was often verbally abused and manipulated by him. However, Morty eventually gained more confidence as time went on and is now more capable and independent rather than a mere sidekick. This newfound confidence also allowed Morty to distance himself from Rick more often due to his despicable tendencies, although Morty still stays by his side when necessary.  </p>
